# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **AndrÃ© Paul Grandsire**, a ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· brazilian developer, located in Buenos Aires. 

ðŸ—£ I can speak _Portuguese_, _English_ and _Spanish_. Have been working with technology since was 15 years old. I've started with Technical Support and make my way up to Full Stack. 

There's some private works that should be released soon in Envato, such as my own CMS and some public works available here and my [Opensource work](https://github.com/startap-opensource). You can contact and sponsor any of these works throught GitHub Sponsor and, soon, others platforms.
