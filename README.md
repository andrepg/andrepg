## ðŸ¤– Who am I?

I'm **AndrÃ© Paul Grandsire**, a brazilian developer, located in Buenos Aires. I can speak _Portuguese_ and have some skills with _English_ and _Spanish_.

## ðŸ’¼ With what I work?

Currently I'm working mostly with `PHP`, `Delphi` and learning `VueJS`. 

In my personal repository there are only Proof of Concepts or simple implementations. In my [OpenSourceAPG organization](https:/github.com/OpenSourceAPG) there's some scripts and work that I collected through of my entire career.
